# Getting Started with `event-driven`

You may have some hardware in front of you that you are unsure of how to use, if not, and you just need help with software, skip ahead.

## Hardware

Hardware could include sensors: ATIS, event-driven skin, cochlea, or IMU, as well as acquisition boards based on zynq chips: ZCB or z-turn. We'll assume the hardware is correctly connected and powered. However, you may need to

### set-up an sd-card for a ZCB or z-turn.

If the system should be already ready-to-go, and you just need the board to start acquisition, you can follow these instructions to

### connect to the ZCB or z-turn.

Once you have a connection to the board, you need to

### set-up the yarpserver

to correctly communicate between your laptop and the board. Finally you will need to

### run `zynqGrabber`

At this point you should be streaming events from the hardware device and you can start to read and process them. You can check you are

### correctly streaming events to your laptop,

once your software is correctly installed on the laptop as well.
